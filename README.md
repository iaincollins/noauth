What is this?
--------------

After reading Aral Balkans posted on "indieauth"
http://aralbalkan.com/notes/on-evolving-indieauth/ I decided to play around a 
bit with the idea, to see what worked well technically, to think about what
sort of solutions exist already and to better understand what they're missing.

This is just for fun and shouldn't be taken seriously.
